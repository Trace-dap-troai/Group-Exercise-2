Regression Analysis Project

Project Description

This project performs a complete regression analysis pipeline on a dataset
with more than 1000 samples and at least 30 features. The workflow includes
data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and
enhancement using advanced regression techniques.

The goal is to build reliable regression models, analyze their performance,
and demonstrate the impact of feature selection and regularization.
